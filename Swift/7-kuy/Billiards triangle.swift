/*
Remember the triangle of balls in billiards? To build a classic triangle (5 levels) you need 15 balls. With 3 balls you can build a 2-level triangle, etc.
For more examples,
pyramid(1) == 1
pyramid(3) == 2
pyramid(6) == 3
pyramid(10) == 4
pyramid(15) == 5
Write a function that takes number of balls (â‰¥ 1) and calculates how many levels you can build a triangle.

func pyramid(_ balls: Int) -> Int {
    var b = balls, n = 0
    while b > 0 {
        n += 1
        b = b - n
    }
    return b == 0 ? n : n - 1
